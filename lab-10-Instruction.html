        <h1>Week 10 Lab - CST8285</h1>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>Upon completion of this lab, you should be able to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Transform a static HTML file into a dynamic PHP template</li>
            <li>Create a web site using dynamic web page elements</li>
            <li>Use the object-oriented capabilities of PHP to define a class, and add methods and properties to that class</li>
            <li>upload the php files to your personal webspace on the Algonquin College network and test them externally</li>
		</ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
		<h3> Step 0 </h3>
		  start working on the lab and test them on Xampp/ Apache on your laptop
		  Make sure your php code run properly and won&#39;t crash
		  Then test the program on remote hosting space
		 <h3> Step 1 </h3>
		 
		Your webspace is accessible via https://www.ottawacampushosting.ca/~laca1234, where laca1234 is your network id.
		Your FTP username is laca1234  and password is password!%! Enables you to access your webspace with the FileZilla FTP client. 
		You will use this to upload your website files to your webspace. You should also use the master password available in FileZilla client 
		to protect your work.
		
		I encourage you to complete this step this Thursday  after lecture period, as it will allow for the timely resolution of any potential 
		and let me know ASAP.We will discuss this this Thursday during the lecture.

		
		
        <h3>Step 2 - Download lab files from Bright Space</h3>
        <p>Download the file <strong>Week10Lab.zip</strong> and save it to your computer in a folder called <code>Week10Lab</code>. The ZIP file contains some HTML files, a css folder with the <code>style.css</code> stylesheet, and an images file with some restaurant-related images.</p>
        <h3>Step 3 - Create the dynamic web page elements</h3>
        <p>PHP gives you the power to re-use code all over a website. This way, you can edit one file, and have those changes ripple through all of the pages that use that code.</p>
        <p>In this step, you will use the <code>index.html</code> file to create re-usable header and footer elements.</p>
        <p>Rename all the html files to .php files</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create two files - <code>header.php</code>, and <code>footer.php</code>.
            </li><li>The <code>header.php</code> will contain the HTML code needed to produce the &lt;head&gt; section, plus the web page header and the navigation menu.</li>
            <li>The <code>footer.php</code> will return the HTML code needed to produce the footer(copyright) section of the webpage, plus any closing tags for elements opened (but not closed) in the header.php file.</li>
            <li>Use the <code>include</code> statement in the <code>index.php</code> to include both the header and footer php files created.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Step 4 - Modify the <code>menu.php</code> and <code>contact.php</code> pages to include the header and footer files</h3>
        <h3>Step 5 - Create a new PHP class called <code>menuItem</code></h3>
        <p>The <code>Menuitem</code> class should contain the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A private property called itemName</li>
            <li>A private property called description</li>
            <li>A private property called price</li>
            <li>A three-argument constructor that populates each of the above-mentioned properties</li>
            <li>Public methods for each of the above mentioned properties</li>
        </ul>
        create a separate php file for your class.And remember to <code>include</code> the files when you instantiate the objects.
        <h3>Step 6 - Using the information provided in the index.html file
		Instantiate four instances of the <code>Menuitem</code> class. and add them to Array()</h3>
		The names are created in the following manner:    notice *1, **2 ... and they are the concatenation of ** &amp; the index of array...
			<h4>The WP Burger *1 </h4> 
			<h4>WP Kebabs **2</h4>
			<h4>The WP Burger ***3</h4>
			<h4>WP Kebabs ****4</h4>
			
		
        populate the four instances of the menuItem class in the index.php file.
		<strong> you are required to use while loop (hint below) to initialize  these instances,otherwise you will receive automatically 0 mark  </strong>
		
		<p>$i = 0; </p>
		<p>while ($i &lt; 4){</p> 
		<p>// instantiate the objects and add them to Array()</p>
		<p>$i++; </p>
        
        <h3>Step 7 - Use the menuItem objects to display the daily special information on the home page</h3>
        Replace the static HTML that displays the daily specials by using the public functions created in the above <code>Menuitem</code> classes.
        
		<h3>Step 8 - Use PHP to display the current year in the footer</h3>
        Replace the hard-coded year in the copyright statement with code that will output the current year.
        <h3>Step 9 - Use PHP to replace the word &quot;Today&#39;s&quot; in &quot;Today&#39;s Specials&quot; with the current day of the week</h3>
        For example, if it&#39;s Monday, it should read &quot;Monday&#39;s Specials&quot;.
        <h2>Submission Requirements</h2>
        The lab must be submitted as follows:
        
          All relevant website files should be uploaded to a folder in your webspace called 
		 <strong>Week10Lab</strong>
